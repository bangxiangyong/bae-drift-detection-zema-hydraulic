# Bayesian autoencoders for drift detection in industrial environments

Development of Bayesian Autoencoders to  quantify  epistemic  and  aleatoric  uncertainties, within the context of real and virtual drifts.

## Dataset

We use a hydraulic condition monitoring dataset recorded at ZEMA Testbed: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Condition+monitoring+of+hydraulic+systems
